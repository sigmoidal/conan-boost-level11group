## For Users

### Do not consume this package directly.  It is intended for use only within other boost packages.

### Basic setup for using with other Boost packages

    $ conan install Boost.Level11Group/1.64.0@bincrafters/stable

### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

    [requires]
    Boost.Level11Group/1.64.0@bincrafters/stable

    [generators]
    txt

Note: It is recommended that you run conan install from a build directory and not the root of the project directory.  This is because conan generates *conanbuildinfo* files specific to a single build configuration which by default comes from an autodetected default profile located in ~/.conan/profiles/default .  If you pass different build configuration options to conan install, it will generate different *conanbuildinfo* files.  Thus, they should not be added to the root of the project, nor committed to git.
