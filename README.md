## This repository holds a conan recipe for a cyclic dependency group featuring multiple libraries.

[Conan.io](https://conan.io) package for [Boost.Level11Group](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/libs/libraries.htm) 

The packages generated with this **conanfile** can be found in [Bintray](https://bintray.com/bincrafters/public-conan/Boost.Level11Group%3Abincrafters).

## For Users

### Do not consume this package directly.  It is intended for use only within other boost packages.

### Basic setup for using with other Boost packages

    $ conan install Boost.Level11Group/1.65.1@bincrafters/stable

### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

    [requires]
    Boost.Level11Group/1.65.1@bincrafters/stable

    [generators]
    txt

Note: It is recommended that you run conan install from a build directory and not the root of the project directory.  This is because conan generates *conanbuildinfo* files specific to a single build configuration which by default comes from an autodetected default profile located in ~/.conan/profiles/default .  If you pass different build configuration options to conan install, it will generate different *conanbuildinfo* files.  Thus, they shoudl not be added to the root of the project, nor committed to git.
